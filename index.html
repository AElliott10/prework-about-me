I've been a product manager in HR for the past 15 years, having lead teams of developers, HR professional and vendors to build HR web applications.

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Becoming a web developer should help me better understand the challenges faced by the developers when I work with them to design and develop a web product. The hope is it will help me become a better product manager.</p>
